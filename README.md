Features Right now 

Flexible Dashboard and BTC Dashboard let you create your own strategy, one with selectboxes and one with slider 
  These have a pie chart, stats tables, scatter, line chart, and monthly returns chart
  The graphs are in a decently good looking style, the sytle of the graphs could be modified to be better, but that is not the priority
  
Portfolio Optimizer Page 
  This lets you Optimize a portfolio you enter in 
    Similar graphs and charts 


TODO/Needs Improvement

 Main task is getting the server to run smoothly 
  I think this task has a couple of different subproblems
  
  First off the server crashes when more than two people use it at the same time, or just randomly. The website is not stable and not reliable, even on the "for viewing" site.
  
  The next thing is the slowness, the site is not smooth with transitions, there is a waiting period, not too long, but long enough to look unprofessional and annoying when         changing the strategy.
  
  Second task is looks 
    Although the graphs have nice colors and styles, they do not fit in the page as nicely as I would like
    Streamlit does not have many features for design and layout, so it is become difficult to make things fit on the page nicely next to eachother 
    
    Adding some front end really cool sytling would be great too, but I dont know how to do that.
